    Proof automation used throughout.  Nothing here is specific to the model: hypotheses are
    learned once ([learn_hyp]), equalities simplified ([simplify_eq], [simplify_tuples],
    [inv]), matches, products and disjunctions taken apart ([simpl_match], [case_match],
    [destruct_products], [destruct_or]), conjunctions split ([split_and]), and goals closed
    ([done], [by], [fast_done]).  [mark] records progress in a proof with a string. *)
